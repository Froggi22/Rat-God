## About

Rat God is an Open Source Discord bot project that will help you in the game Escape From Tarkov, and is covered by the [Affero General Public License version 3](LICENSE)! It obtains information from the Official Escape from Tarkov Wiki and delivers it to the user with a slash command request. This bot benefits the user due to it being a fast lookup for ammunition and maps details, and most likely faster than looking it up on said Wiki!

This project is constantly being worked on and improved upon by a few people as a hobby. So please show your support in the Discord Support Server! And if you're a very kind soul, you can check out the [Patreon site](https://www.patreon.com/Froggi22)!

### Data Collection

This project does not collect nor store any data, thus not selling anything to 3rd parties - Because ignorance is bliss.

### Why Open Source

Here are the following reasons why this project is open source and supporting the movement:

#### **Peer review & Reliability**

Since the source code is freely accessible and any peer programmers can contribute, it turns into living code rather than closed and stagnant. Consequently, this may result that the community could keep updating the project and make it outlive its original authors. Additionally, this means that you can find help, resources, and perspectives that reach beyond one interest group or company.

#### **Transparency**

All code changes, data tracking, and collections are public and allow you to check and track that for yourself without relying on vendor promises. This results in a trustworthy and reliable product or service as you can see all the shenanigans going on.

#### **Flexibility**

The emphasis on modification can make the community address their unique problems with code suggestions. Alternatively, create forks and add said specific features tailored to their needs. Another flexibility perk is the freedom - you can take your open source code anywhere and use it for anything, at any time.

#### **The Price Tag**

Services that are open source are often also free of charge, like this project.

### How This Project Makes Money

This project does not make any money. However, you can make donations on our [Patreon site](https://www.patreon.com/Froggi22) to support this project!
