## About üí°

Rat God is an Open Source Discord bot that helps you in the game Escape From Tarkov, and is covered by the [Affero General Public License version 3](LICENSE)! The information is sourced from the game and the Official Wiki. It can be requested using [Discord's slash commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ). This bot benefits the user because it's a fast lookup for ammunition and maps details, presents unique data and is more than likely faster than looking it up on said Wiki!

This project is constantly being worked on and improved upon by a few people as a hobby. So please show your support in the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/kg7VfRQ9Xw)!

#### Slash Commands üß™

To make [slash commands](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000368501-Slash-Commands-FAQ) work during testing with your bot, edit the [config.json](config.json) file and change `developerGuildID` & `developers` to your [server and user ID](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-), respectively. Run your bot, find a text channel in your server where the bot has access to, and enter `!guild`. The`!guild` command will enable slash commands instantly in said server. If you would like to execute slash commands globally (in other servers and DM's), enter `!global` instead. Please note that global slash commands can take up to an hour to set up!
